*1. Refer to the CIRCAREA program in Chapter 2, “C++ Programming Basics.” Write a function
called circarea() that finds the area of a circle in a similar way. It should take an
argument of type float and return an argument of the same type. Write a main() function
that gets a radius value from the user, calls circarea(), and displays the result.

*2. Raising a number n to a power p is the same as multiplying n by itself p times. Write a
function called power() that takes a double value for n and an int value for p, and
returns the result as a double value. Use a default argument of 2 for p, so that if this
argument is omitted, the number n will be squared. Write a main() function that gets values
from the user to test this function.

*3. Write a function called zeroSmaller() that is passed two int arguments by reference
and then sets the smaller of the two numbers to 0. Write a main() program to exercise
this function.
